## About Project

The Tamil Kavi Website ([tamilkavi.jigg.win](https://tamilkavi.jigg.win)) serves as the online presence for the TamilKavi project. It provides a user-friendly interface to explore the collection of Tamil poetry, learn about the associated Python package and dataset, and offers a convenient way for contributors to submit new poems to the collection via a dedicated submission form.

This website complements the [TamilKavi Python Package](https://github.com/anandsundaramoorthysa/tamilkavi) by offering a browser-based experience.

This website is built using the following technologies:

* **Frontend:** React
* **Language:** TypeScript
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **Icons:** Lucide React
* **Package Manager:** npm, Yarn, or pnpm

## Installation (for local development)

To set up and run the website locally for development or testing:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/anandsundaramoorthysa/tamilkaviwebsite.git](https://github.com/anandsundaramoorthysa/tamilkaviwebsite.git) 
    cd tamilkaviwebsite 
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:** Make sure you have Node.js and npm/yarn/pnpm installed. Then run:
